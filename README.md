**This project contains the code required to replicate a pharmacovigilance analysis of the cardiovascular toxicity of BTE-related Cardiotoxicity**

Briefly, the outline of the code is structured as follows:
1. First, open the "Source BiTE.R" file. This file will run all of the analyses required to reproduce our results as it directly calls all of the other relevant files stored here.
2. Once this is done, "BiTE Results" file can be run to generate the **Results** section of our manuscript.
3. Please note that this analysis requires that you obtain the dictionary used to classify adverse events from MedDRA (https://www.meddra.org/) in order to create the files needed to define the various adverse events herein. In general, non-commercial users can obtain it by contacting MedDRA for an institutional license.
